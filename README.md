This is a new take on the Redstrap theme. Now we're using Bootstrap 3.

The whole repository should be cloned in a <redroot>/view/theme/redstrap3/ and then activated through the admin interface.

THING STILL TO DO:

 * Integrate with FontAwesome
 * Integrate with Bootswatch (with a settings entry and all)
 * ...
