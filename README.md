This is a new take on the Redstrap theme. Now we're using Bootstrap 3.

Philosophy
==========

RS3 is build from Redbasic, but it doesn't intend to stay a pure (P)CSS variant. As such, we tweak templates as needed, and we will eventually remove a LOT of CSS code. Basically, we don't try to define (badly) what Bootstrap already did right.

RS3 extensively uses Font-Awesome (version 3 for now, to be updated as soon as there is a mechanism for dealing with different icon sets within Red).

RS3 comes with the marvelous alternative CSS from the Bootswatch (http://bootswatch.com/) project. That way, you could switch between different designs just by visiting "Display Settings".
